# Recipe

## Overview
This repo is for the software implementation of RecipeApps. It involves two forms, one that opens when the program is run, and one that opens when the user interacts with the app. A more detailed description of the functions of the app is given below

##RecipeApps
The user is presented with a search bar in which they type some or all of the recipe name. A list of recipes will appear below according to their search input. The user can double click on any of these recipes to open a new form with more detail on that recipe.

**The full spec for this app is in the repo.**
